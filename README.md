# REST Countries API App

This app uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull in country data and display it.

You can search for countries by name and filter by region. It also has a dark theme toggle.

- Created with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- The app is written in TypeScript (first time using TypeScript)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for data fetching.
- [React Map GL](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/) to show each country on a map.

This was a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
